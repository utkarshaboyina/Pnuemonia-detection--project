# Pnuemonia-detection--project
A CNN-based deep learning model using PySpark is proposed for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Distributed training across Spark nodes reduces computation time and improves scalability. The model outperforms ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19, achieving 1.5Ã— faster and more accurate predictions.
